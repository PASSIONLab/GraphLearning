## Minutes

- Discussion on GNNs vs CNNs, Transformers vs GNNs, and whether we need any induction bias. 
- Discussion on whether the test cases in the Correct&Smooth paper are too simple. 
- Discussion on whether the proposed C&S model is any easier to tune and/or run compared to GNNs. 
- We also talked about the issues with the authors' understanding of the topic in the Reddit post
- Paper for future reading: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01261.pdf
