## Minutes

- Solving a series of successively harder DP problems with GNNs.
  * Needleman-Wunsch on pairs of reads
  * Smith-Waterman on pairs of reads
  * Sequence to graph alignment (potentially useful for pangenomes)
  * Many-to-many sequence alignment
  * Assembly on error-free reads
  * Assembly on erroneous reads

- Combining Label Propagation and Simple Models out-performs Graph Neural Networks: https://openreview.net/forum?id=8E1-f3VhX1o

## Minutes

- Discussion on GNNs vs CNNs, Transformers vs GNNs, and whether we need any induction bias. 
- Discussion on whether the test cases in the Correct&Smooth paper are too simple. 
- Discussion on whether the proposed C&S model is any easier to tune and/or run compared to GNNs. 
- We also talked about the issues with the authors' understanding of the topic in the Reddit post
- Paper for potential future reading: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01261.pdf
